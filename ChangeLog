	* KeyParaStocX (then - Pozeracz ustaw) 0.1.0:
	  Initial version: finds Parts, Books, Titles, Sections, Chapters,
	  Subchapters and Articles, changes their style to an appropriate
	  header and generates the table of contents from them. If no Articles
	  are found, the last level of the ToC are Paragraphs.
	  Paragraphs and Articles inside table cells are skipped (they cause
	  errors).
	  After the ToC, a page break is inserted and the following pages are
	  numbered from 1.
